# Getting Started 

## Welcome to Reporting

The Fiserv Reporting APIs are built on the foundation of REST. The APIs accept standard JSON requests and return JSON encoded responses while leveraging industry standard [HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for a seamless integration. Interaction through our Reporting APIs provides the developer community the ability to retrieve transaction, chargeback, funding and settlement information in a simple and intuitive manner. You will find that access to itemized or summary data can be quickly initiated programmatically for statistical analysis purposes.

## API Structure

## Data Retrieval
>Data can be accessed in two ways. Each domain model supports both itemized transaction download as well as summarized data. In order to utilize the API for the data that you are interested, the developer will need to retrieve the meta data associated with that domain model.
