# Domain Models

## What are Domain Models?
Domain models represent the type of data that you may be interested in.  IE authorization transactions, chargebacks, etc. Reporting supports the following domain models. 

### Authorizations 
>Authorizations refers to the transactions as soon as they are received by the receiving end point. An authorization can either be Approved or Declined. There are many details associated with the transaction that will determine where the authorization is ultimately routed to. The transaction details are captured in this report.

### Chargebacks
>The Disputes Overview provides an overview of Outstanding, Reversed, and Closed Chargebacks. Merchants can quickly see the total number of Open, Fulfilled, and Expired Retrievals, as well as the total number of Chargebacks that are Open, Closed, and Reversed.

### Disbursements
>Fiserv’s Digital Disbursement product allows a business to create a payment to a consumer (B2C) or another business (B2B) electronically.  Likewise, the product allows the recipient to select the method to be used to disburse the payment.
>
>The basic steps used to complete a Digital Disbursement are as follows:
> - Merchant Identifies the Recipient(s)
> - Merchant Initiates the Payment(s)
> - Merchant Approves the Payment(s) via Workflow Management 
> - Merchant Notifies the Recipient(s)
> - Recipient accepts the Payment (Acceptance Process)
> - Recipient selects a Disbursement Method
> - Fiserv disburses Funds to the recipient  via the chosen method.

### Retrievals

The Retrievals selection will help you facilitate the process of retrieving and fulfilling sales draft requests. In some instances, unanswered retrieval requests can result in a chargeback being initiated by the issuing bank.
